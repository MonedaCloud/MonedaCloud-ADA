## MOC Reward Program


### OVERVIEW

Moneda Cloud IO is sharing 10% of MOC Cardano pool operator rewards to the top ten delegators. The portion of the rewards will be distributed proportionally to all qualified delegates. There will be a maximum of ten delegators participating in the program at any given time. Payouts will be made at the end of every epoch if applicable.

### TOP-10 REWARD PROGRAM

How to qualify for the Top-10 Reward Program:

1. Delegators must stake a minimum of 10K ADA to MonedaCloud [MOC].

2. Delegators must meet their minimum stake to maintain their status active in the program. Once a participant undelages their ADA, he/she will become inactive from the program. Next delegate in line will take his/her place.

3. Top ten qualified delegates can increase their stake over time.

4. The order in which qualified delegators enter the program matters. The first TOP-10 will be locked in place not losing their place in the program as long as they meet their minimum stake.
